The year is 1431. It all began with a knight living happily in a small vilage allong with other knights and their familys. One night the ground began to shake, Hades (the god of the underworld) rose out of the underworld and attacked the village out of nowhere because he was bored. All hell broke loos, death after death happened. Hades burned the whole village down. Fire everywhere, wooden houses burning down until nothing was left over.

Once Hades destroyed everything and had his fun everything was burned to the ground. Every living organisme has died ... he looked at it, laughed and left ... Until. An arm rose out of the ground, meaning that someone still was alive! It was the knight from the beginning, he has made it out alive. He kicked all of the burning wood away and stood up. Only to see all his beloved ones gone. He let out a tear and said the following \***\*_"Hades, where-ever you are hiding. I will find you_\*\***
